# GUI-PasswordGenerator
A GUI in Python for a simple password generator (also in Python). 

why? quick small project to learn how guizero works. Pretty cool stuff.
have a look: [Guizero home page]('https://lawsie.github.io/guizero/start/')

## Functions
You can generate a password (string) by indicating the number of characters.
